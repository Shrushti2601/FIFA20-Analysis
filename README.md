Description:
Led an analytical project focused on FIFA20 player data to uncover key performance insights and categorize players based on their skills and potential. Utilized advanced data cleaning techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to provide actionable insights and robust clustering performance.

Data Analysis and Cleaning:

Conducted comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values in 48 columns and addressing outliers, ensuring high-quality analysis.
Performance Insights:

Identified key player attributes, with most players aged 20-30, an average height of 180 cm, and weight between 65-80 kg.
Skills Evaluation:

Analyzed and categorized player skills, finding that most players have moderate technical skills (rated 60-65) and strong physical attributes (rated 65-70).
Work Rate and Foot Preference:

Determined that 54% of players have a medium work rate, and 76.4% prefer the right foot, indicating versatility and predominant right-foot preference.
Clustering Model Performance:

Evaluated clustering models (K-Means, GMM, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) using Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin scores, with Hierarchical Clustering (0.676, 0.509) and K-Means (0.672, 0.539) showing the best performance.
